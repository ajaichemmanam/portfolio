## Image Augmentation

Image Augmentation is the technique of artificially creating more data by altering the existing ones. This manipulation involves operations like shifts, flips, zooms etc.

#### Advantages:

- It expands the training dataset.

- It can prevent overfitting

- It can add to the generalisation of the model

- The model becomes spatially invariant.

#### Limitations:

- Requires evaluation of the created data.

- The biases in real data are also reflected in augmented data.
