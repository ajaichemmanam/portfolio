This is my first blog on research. Being a researcher, I found that it's always difficult to find the right tools/person to help guide you through the challenging times. In this blog, I try to introduce you to some tools that can be useful to those who are actively in research and as well as for those who are starting their incredible journey.

## Connected Papers

With connected papers, we can build a graph of papers relevant to a particular field and discover prior or derivatives works in our field of interest. It is also useful to create a bibliography for your papers.

It allows researchers to keep track of recent papers, search for papers, sort papers by similarity to any paper, see recent popular papers, add papers to a personal library, and get personalized recommendations of (new or old) Arxiv papers.
