Publishing research findings in top conferences and journals are the most important part of any research. It helps us to disseminate knowledge to others and also get our work peer reviewed.

Any researcher who intends to publish papers in conferences and journals should keep a list of top conferences and journals in their fields.

Being a Computer Vision researcher, My list of journals is published below.
